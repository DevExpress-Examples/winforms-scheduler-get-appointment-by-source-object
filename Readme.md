# WinForms Scheduler - Obtain appointments by an object in the data source

The [PersistentObject.GetSourceObject](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.PersistentObject.GetSourceObject(DevExpress.XtraScheduler.ISchedulerStorageBase)) method allows you to obtain a source object that corresponds to a specific appointment. This example shows how to obtain an appoitnment by an object in the data source.

The example handles the [SchedulerStorageBase.AppointmentCollectionLoaded](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerStorageBase.AppointmentCollectionLoaded) event to create a Hashtable/Dictionary where source objects are keys and appointments are values.

For recurring patterns, you should iterate through exceptions using the [Appointment.GetExceptions]() method.
