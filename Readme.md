# How to obtain appointments based on the source data object


<p><strong>Problem:</strong> There is a <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerPersistentObject_GetSourceObjecttopic"><u>PersistentObject.GetSourceObject Method</u></a> that allows retrieving a source object, associated with a specified appointment. However, there is no "reverse" method that allows retrieving an appointment by the source object which might be useful in some scenarios.<br />
<strong>Solution:</strong> The most efficient method to implement this functionality is to build a Hashtable/Dictionary with source objects as keys and appointments as values. This can be done in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerStorageBase_AppointmentCollectionLoadedtopic"><u>SchedulerStorageBase.AppointmentCollectionLoaded Event</u></a> handler. Note that for recurring patterns, you should iterate through their exceptions manually (use the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerAppointment_GetExceptionstopic"><u>Appointment.GetExceptions Method</u></a> to obtain exceptions of the specified appointment).</p><p><strong>See also:</strong><br />
